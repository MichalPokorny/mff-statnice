\subsection{Aproximaèní algoritmy}

NP-hard problems vary greatly in their approximability; some, such as the bin packing problem (baleni batohu), can be approximated within any factor greater than 1 (such a family of approximation algorithms is often called a polynomial time approximation scheme or PTAS). Others are impossible to approximate within any constant, or even polynomial factor unless P = NP, such as the maximum clique problem (hledani maximalni kliky).
